Parameter Tampering 



Background Concept about Parameter Tampering 

The Web Parameter Tampering attack is based on the manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server 
in order to modify application data, such as user 
credentials and permissions, price and quantity of products, etc. Usually, this information is stored in cookies, hidden form fields, 
or URL Query Strings, and is used to increase application functionality and control.


Eg 1:

The parameter modification of form fields can be considered a typical example of Web Parameter Tampering attack
For example, consider a user who can select form field values (combo box, check box, etc.) on an application page
When these values are submitted by the user, they could be acquired and arbitrarily manipulated by an attacker.


Eg 2:

<input type=”hidden” id=”1008” name=”cost” value=”70.00”>

●In this example, an attacker can modify the “value” information of a specific item, thus lowering its cost.


Eg 3:
http://www.attackbank.com/default.asp?profile=741&debit=1000

●In this case, an attacker could tamper with the URL, 
using other values for profile and debit:http://www.attackbank.com/default.asp?profile=852&debit=2000
