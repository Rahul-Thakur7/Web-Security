File Uploading


Background Concept about File Uploading
●Uploaded  files  represent  a  significant  risk  to  applications.  
The  first  step  in  many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. 
Then the attack only needs to  find  a  way  to  get  the  code  executed. 
Using  a  file  upload  helps  the  attacker accomplish the first step.

●The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover, 
an  overloaded  file  system  or  database,  forwarding  attacks  to  back-end systems,  client-side  attacks,  or  simple  defacement.  
It  depends  on  what  the application does with the uploaded file and especially where it is stored.
