spf Record or Not ?

Sender Policy Framework, or SPF, is a technical standard that helps protect email senders and recipients from spam, spoofing, 
and phishing. It is a form of email authentication

Specifically, it defines a way to validate that an email message was sent from an authorized mail server, 
in order to detect forgery and to prevent spam. It was designed to supplement SMTP, the basic protocol used to send email, 
because SMTP does not itself include any authentication mechanisms


What is an SPF record?

An SPF record is included in an organization’s DNS database. 
An SPF record is a specially-formatted version of a standard DNS TXT record. 
An SPF record looks something like this
:v=spf1 include:_spf-a.microsoft.com include
:_spf-b.microsoft.com include:_spf-c.microsoft.com 
include:_spf-ssg-a.microsoft.com 
include:spf-a.hotmail.com
